# Registration_form
This is an exercise to practice HTML and CSS. I've built a Registration Form for arbitrary "workshops" using HTML and CSS in the following case.
This project used radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown menus, and other basic HTML syntax.

This is what the website looks like! ![image](https://github.com/Nav-da-great/Registration_form/assets/113965179/5f6787b3-65ab-4729-9536-fa94b52f5ac3)
