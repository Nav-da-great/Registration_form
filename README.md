# Registration_form
This is an exercise to practice front-end development. In the following case, I've built a Registration Form for arbitrary "workshops" using HTML and CSS.
This project made use of radio buttons, checkboxes and dropdown menus along with other basic HTML syntax.

This is what the website looks like! ![image](https://github.com/Nav-da-great/Registration_form/assets/113965179/5f6787b3-65ab-4729-9536-fa94b52f5ac3)
